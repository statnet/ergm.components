# `ergm.components`:  ERGM Terms Based on Connectivity and Components

`ergm.components` contains additional ERGM terms (suitable for use with `ergm`, `ergmgp`, `tergm`, `Bergm`, or any other `ergm`-compatible packages or functions) relating to connectivity and component size distributions.  Once the package is loaded, these terms can be used just like any other `ergm` terms - no further actions or special tools are required.

To get started after installing and loading the package, see

```
?"ergm.components"
```
for more information.  

## Installing Directly from GitHub

To install from GitHub, first ensure that you have the `devtools` package installed and loaded. Then, type the following: 

```
install_github("statnet/ergm.components")
```
Alternately, cloning this repository and building/installing the package locally is another option.
